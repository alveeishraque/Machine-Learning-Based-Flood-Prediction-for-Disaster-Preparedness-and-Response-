# Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning  
This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance flood prediction accuracy, aiming to improve disaster preparedness and response.  

### Features:  
- Utilizes historical meteorological data, river flow measurements, and land use patterns for analysis.  
- Implements ML models such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN, and neural networks.  
- Achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy over traditional methods.  

### Goals:  
- Identify patterns and relationships within data to predict flooding events.  
- Provide timely alerts to mitigate risks and enhance community resilience.
